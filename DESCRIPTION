Description: PPIpriority allows to perform target prioritization based on 
    random walk with restart on PPI networks. This package is based on the
    STRINGdb for retrieving PPI network information. The propritization is done
    in a convenient two-step process, that is perfomed based on a list of genes
    known to be involved in the phenotype/biological process of interest.
